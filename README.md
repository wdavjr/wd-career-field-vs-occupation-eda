# EDA of Occupation vs Field of Study

## Overview
This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focusing on the relationship between occupations and fields of study. Using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, the project aims to uncover trends and insights through data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Objectives
- Analyze the correlation between various occupations and fields of study.
- Identify significant trends or patterns within the dataset.
- Demonstrate skills in data manipulation, visualization, and storytelling.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). It contains information about individuals' occupations and their corresponding fields of study.

### Key Features:
- **Field of Study**: Educational background or specialization.
- **Occupation**: Job titles or sectors.
- Additional demographic or contextual data (if available).

## Tools & Libraries
This project uses the following tools and libraries:
- **Python**
  - Pandas (data manipulation)
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn (visualizations)
  - NumPy (numerical operations)
  - Jupyter Notebook (development environment)

## Steps in Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Standardize categorical data.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Generate descriptive statistics.
   - Create visualizations to explore relationships between fields of study and occupations.

3. **Insights and Findings**
   - Summarize trends and key takeaways from the data.

## Results
- Insights will be documented as the project progresses.
- Visualizations and statistical findings will be included to support the analysis.

## How to Use This Repository
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/wd-occupation-field-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebook to follow the analysis step-by-step.

## Future Work
- Perform predictive modeling to forecast occupations based on fields of study.
- Expand analysis to include additional datasets for broader insights.
